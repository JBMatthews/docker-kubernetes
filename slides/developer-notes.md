## Working To-Do-List

###### 2017-05-20
+ Make sure all the "Agenda" slides throughout the presentation are congruent.
+ Also, make sure all "Recap" slides are consisten with previous lesson's
* IF, you get time, add a "Compsose in Production" section in the slides!

###### 2017-05-21
+ Consider adding ($) to shell code samples in slides
+ Consider adding (#) to Docker shell code samples in slides
+ Check punc and gramm on slides and labs 

###### 2017-05-22
+ Look at the pretense of slides wordage. Reads more like a lab, not a lesson. Change.
+ Make sure to carry <em>bold</em> word emphasis throughout slides.

###### 2017-05-24
+ Maybe not possible now, but take Dockerfile content out of Slides 03, and put them Slides 02. Incorprate the instruction being used to build Tomcat app.

###### 2017-05-25
+ 03 Slides are problematic. Mid-lesson example doesn't make sense and cannot be replicated given our resources. Consider how you might fix this.
+ Worried about grammar and more so puncuation

###### 2017-06-06
+ 10 Within slide diamgrams... pick "lowercap" for ALL text, other than Brands

###### 2017-06-07
+ GOTTA include Virtuant Logo in EACH slide's footer and consider including a plain Docker logo icon as way.
