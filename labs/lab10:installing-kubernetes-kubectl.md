## Installing Kubernetes Kubectl
**Objective:** Install kubectl, install Run two instances of a Hello World application, and create a Service object that exposes a node port. We will also use the Service object to access the running application.
**Preparation:** Open a single terminal window and confirm internet connection. Inform instructor if you are unable to access the web.
**Outcome:** Participant will complete this lab when Kubernetes CLI tool kubectl is fully installed and configured.
**Data Files:** Ask the instructor what files are needed for this lab.

To deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes, you’ll use the Kubernetes command-line tool, ```kubectl```. It lets you inspect your cluster resources, create, delete, and update components, and much more. You will use it to look at your new cluster and bring up example apps.

## Step 1. Choose Option 1 only for current lab:

##### Option 1. *Install kubectl Binary Via curl*

1. Download the latest release with the command:<br>

###### OS X

```
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
```

###### Linux

```
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```

###### Windows

```
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe
```

>NOTE: If you want to download a specific version of ```kubectl``` you can replace the nested curl command from above with the version you want. (e.g. ```v1.4.6, v1.5.0-beta.2```)

2. Make the ```kubectl``` binary executable and move it to your PATH (e.g. ```/usr/local/bin```):

```
$ chmod +x ./kubectl
$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

##### Option 2. Extract kubectl from Release .tar.gz or Compiled Source

1. Ask the instructor where the Compiled Source tar file is located.<br>

2. Copy or move ```kubectl``` into a directory already in your PATH (e.g. ```/usr/local/bin```). For example:

###### OS X

```
$ sudo cp platforms/darwin/amd64/kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

###### Linux

```
$ sudo cp platforms/linux/amd64/kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

3. Next make it executable with the following command:

```
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

4. The ```kubectl``` binary doesn’t have to be installed to be executable, but the rest of the walkthrough will assume that it’s in your ```PATH```. If you prefer not to copy ```kubectl```, you need to ensure it is in your path:

###### OS X

```
export PATH=<path/to/kubernetes-directory>/platforms/darwin/amd64:$PATH
```

###### Linux

```
export PATH=<path/to/kubernetes-directory>/platforms/linux/amd64:$PATH
```

##### Option 3. Download as part of the Google Cloud SDK

```kubectl``` can be installed as part of the Google Cloud SDK:
1. First install the Google Cloud SDK (```https://cloud.google.com/sdk/```).
2. After Google Cloud SDK installs, run the following command to install ```kubectl```:
```
$ gcloud components install kubectl
```
3. Do check that the version is sufficiently up-to-date using: 

```
kubectl version
```

#### Step 2. Configuring kubectl [Ask Instructor Before Proceeding]

In order for ```kubectl``` to find and access the Kubernetes cluster, it needs a kubeconfig file, which is created automatically when creating a cluster using ```kube-up.sh```. By default, ```kubectl``` configuration lives at ~/.kube/config.
1. Make sure you're ready. Check that ```kubectl``` is properly configured by getting the cluster state:

```
$ kubectl cluster-info
```

If you see a url response, you are ready to go.
